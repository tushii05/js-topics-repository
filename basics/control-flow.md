# Control Flow in JavaScript

Control flow in JavaScript allows us to make decisions, repeat actions, or control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. The main control flow statements in JavaScript are **if/else**, **switch**, and **loops**.

## **1. If/Else Statement**

The `if/else` statement is used to execute code based on whether a condition is true or false.

### Syntax:

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // Code to run if condition is true
} else {
  // Code to run if condition is false
}
```

## **2. Switch Statement**

The switch statement is used to execute different blocks of code based on different conditions. It's typically used when you need to compare a single expression against multiple possible values.

##syntax

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to run if expression equals value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to run if expression equals value2
    break;
  default:
  // Code to run if expression doesn't match any case
}
```
