# Error Handling in JavaScript

## Overview

Error handling is essential for building robust applications. JavaScript provides the `try-catch-finally` block for managing errors.

### **Using `try-catch`**

The `try` block contains code that may throw an error, while the `catch` block handles it.

```javascript
try {
  // Code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error
}
```
