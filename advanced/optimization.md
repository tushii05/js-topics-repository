Performance is critical for both client-side and server-side JavaScript applications. Here are some common techniques for optimizing JavaScript performance.

## 1. **Minification and Bundling**

- **Minification:** Removes unnecessary characters (like whitespace and comments) from the code.
- **Bundling:** Combines multiple JavaScript files into a single file to reduce HTTP requests.

## 2. **Asynchronous Programming**

Using async/await, Promise, setTimeout, and other asynchronous patterns allows non-blocking operations, improving the responsiveness of applications.

## 3.** Using Higher-Order Array Methods:**

JavaScript provides powerful array methods like map, forEach, filter, and reduce that allow for functional programming styles, making the code more concise and performant.

```javascript
Example: Using map and forEach
// Example of using map() and forEach()
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using map to create a new array with values doubled
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(number => number \* 2);
console.log(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// Using forEach to iterate over array without returning a new array
numbers.forEach(number => console.log(number));
// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (prints each number in the array)
```

**Key Differences:**
**map():** Transforms each element in the array and returns a new array with the transformed elements.

**forEach():** Executes a function on each element but does not return a new array.

## 4. **Lazy Loading**

Load resources (like images, scripts) only when needed to reduce the initial page load time.

## 5. **Code Splitting**

Break large bundles into smaller chunks so that only the necessary code is loaded at the start.
