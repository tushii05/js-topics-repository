Performance is critical for both client-side and server-side JavaScript applications. Here are some common techniques for optimizing JavaScript performance.

## 1. **Minification and Bundling**

- **Minification:** Removes unnecessary characters (like whitespace and comments) from the code.
- **Bundling:** Combines multiple JavaScript files into a single file to reduce HTTP requests.

## 2. **Asynchronous Programming**

Using async/await, Promise, setTimeout, and other asynchronous patterns allows non-blocking operations, improving the responsiveness of applications.

## 3. **Lazy Loading**

Load resources (like images, scripts) only when needed to reduce the initial page load time.

## 4. **Code Splitting**

Break large bundles into smaller chunks so that only the necessary code is loaded at the start.
